# jadsh 

> Just Another Dumb SHell

Experiments with making a really dumb, slow shell in Python. This will never be usable. Heck you probably shouldn't even look at it. But, I'm making it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5+
- Unix terminal with ANSI escape code support
- virtualenv

## Setup

Initialize virtualenv and install requirements.

```bash
virtualenv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch the shell.

```bash
./jadsh.py
```

## OS Support

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04. Should support any unix terminal with ANSI escape code support.
