> Just A Dumb Shell

Experiments with making a really dumb, slow shell in Python. This will never be usable. Heck you probably shouldn't even look at it. But, I'm making it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5+

## Setup

Initialize virtualenv and install requirements.

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

Launch the shell.

```bash
python run.py
```
